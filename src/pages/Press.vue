                        GlobalHorizon Business development executive Bella Inglewood said: “The results indicate that people are looking now more than ever for certainty and security amid a landscape of economic and political change.” Inglewood believes the uncertainty created by the general election result could reinvigorate the conversation around second citizenship: “Brexit has clearly had an influence on the UK’s views on citizenship and I believe the current political context stimulates similar discussion. It has always been our advice however to act preventively in the face of potential uncertainty: second citizenship is an insurance policy against socio-political change.”</p>
