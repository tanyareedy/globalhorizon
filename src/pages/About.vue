            <p class="text-justify">Global Horizon is an award-winning industry-leading legal consultancy firm specialising in
              citizenship
              and residence solutions. We liaise between governments wishing to promote foreign investments in
              their
              countries, and individuals wanting to secure their future and become global citizens through
              intelligent
              economic citizenship.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              The team at Global Horizon has extensive experience in the field of immigration, citizenship, and
              residence. We are composed of professionals from all over the world, with many of us having lived in
              multiple countries across the globe. In this sense, we have first-hand knowledge of how important,
              worrying, and sometimes emotionally taxing a second citizenship or residence decision may be for an
              individual and his or her family. Our goal is thus to make this decision easy and headache-free, and
              to provide a constant guiding hand to our clients throughout their second citizenship or residence
              application

          <p class="text-justify"> Citizenship and residence by investment programmes are an exciting way for global individuals to bring
            their talent, skills, and experience to nations other than those in which they were born. At Global
            horizon
            we have played a role in the promotion and evaluation of many such programmes.

            Global horizon collaborates with numerous businesses and professionals, with the goal of making second
            citizenship or residence a reality for as many individuals as possible. We have robust ties with the
            media, and have built long-lasting relationships with legal experts focusing on immigration, tax, and
            real estate law. Finally, we have a close rapport with advisors specialising in wealth management,
            investment management, personal financial advice, and family assets.

            As one of our partners, you or your company would be associated with a firm that is government mandated,
            with an outstanding record of delivering second citizenship or residence solutions to its clients. You
            can expect to receive up-to-date information on changes to the citizenship or residence by investment
            programmes in the jurisdictions that are most pertinent to you, as well as updates on local real estate
            developments, government-sponsored programmes, and other indicators of economic growth. Additionally,
            you would be invited to the many exclusive events Global horizon organises around the world,
            providing you with the opportunity to further understand the programmes and network with other
            business persons and their clients.
